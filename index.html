        <p>He loved; She loved. They both loved each other, despite their tender age. When the girl's elder brother asked her about the boy, she claimed, 'He's the one who loves me, but I don't love him. I didn't like him from the beginning; he's the one who is always lagging behind me. I even blocked him on Face book, but the next day, he came to my house too.' She continued, 'Don't tell that boy whatever I said to you, because he will think that I am tricking on him.' The girl's words were all a lie, a false accusation against the boy, and he knew it. But he kept quiet, saying nothing to her brother.

The boy, deeply in affection with the girl, understood that the truth might only complicate matters further. So, he chose to endure the pain of false accusations in silence, hoping that someday the girl would come to her senses.

As time passed, the boy's relationship with the girl's brother slowly vanished, damaged by the girl's lies. Yet, his love for her remained unwavering, trapped in the depths of his heart, as he continued to dream of her every night, entangled in a spell within his dreams. In a bid to see her in his dreams, he began sleeping excessively, hoping against hope that she would appear.
