        <h1 class="title">&times; Recalling Dreams &times;</h1>
        <p>She came once again, this time to the temple, wearing a pretty dress and accompanied by her mother. I was so confused, unable to grasp what was happening. She wore the same dress, with the same expression—"a pretty girl in every way," "a pretty girl in my heart." I stood a little distance away. As soon as her mother recognized me, she began calling me over. My hands were shaking, and my mind was tangled with thoughts and emotions. I hesitated to approach them, unsure how to handle the situation. I thought it would be rude to ignore her mother’s invitation, but I also didn’t want to intrude.

            So, I decided to say, "I’m sorry, but my friends are waiting for me behind the temple, and I’m already late." I couldn’t recall her exact expression, but she seemed a bit upset. I glanced at Ritika, who was sitting behind her mother in the temple’s resting area. Ritika was giving me signals, and I interpreted them as a hint that I had made a mistake. Her mother kept insisting I come closer. Ritika seemed both ecstatic and angry because of my initial response and my excuse about my friends.
            
            I set aside the situation with my friends and faced a dilemma. I chose to go to them and deal with my friends later. Her mother said, "You stay and talk to her; I’ll get you some juice." After saying this, she left. At that moment, it was just Ritika and me. My hands continued to shake, and instead of discussing anything else, she asked why I had responded to her mother that way initially. My hands shook as she noticed, and I had no words to explain. I asked, "What should I have said to her? It’s been so many years since I’ve seen her, and even longer since I’ve seen you." My response was blunt.
            
            She replied, "Mother wanted to see you; she talks about you to me." I wondered why we had lost touch after graduating from grade 10. Seeing her, someone I had adored since grade 2, brought back many memories. If I had known then what I know now, I would have confessed my feelings back then.
            
            Her mother returned with a bottle of juice and two glasses. I asked, "Why only two glasses?" She replied, "Yes, that’s just for the two of you. I’m going for a photoshoot near the main gate." With a smile, she left again. I asked Ritika, "You told me that she was looking forward to seeing me, but she left us alone here." Ritika smiled and served the glasses. I repeatedly asked her the same question. At that moment, my heart was wide open, and my hands had stopped shaking. Ritika began with, "Oh, you silly thing, I’ve been trying to reach out to you all this time." Her eyes, however, didn’t match her words; they were slightly teary.
            
            I was at a loss for what to do. My mind was blank. I approached her, and as soon as I started to speak, she hugged me. My whole body was filled with a comforting sensation from her embrace. I hugged her back, and she rested her head on my shoulder. Time seemed to stand still as we held each other. The world around us faded away; I was unaware and unconcerned about anything else happening around me.
            <br><br>
            And then, suddenly, the scene began to blur and dissolve. The warmth of her embrace, the scent of her fragrance, and the sound of her voice started to fade. I felt a sense of drifting away, as if I were being pulled from the moment itself. My heart raced with a mixture of longing and confusion. Just as I was about to speak again, everything dissolved into darkness. I was left with a lingering sense of yearning and a haunting question: Was it all just a dream, or could this moment become a reality?
<br><br>
I awoke, my heart pounding, realizing that the dream I had just experienced was the greatest hope of my life—a hope of meeting her again. The lines between reality and dreams had blurred, leaving me with the bittersweet echo of what could be.
