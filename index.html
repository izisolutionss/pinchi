        <p>He loved; She loved. They both loved each other, despite their tender age. When the girl's elder brother
            asked her about the boy, she claimed, 'He's the one who loves me, but I don't love him.' The girl wasn't
            being truthful; fear had woven its web around her. She didn’t want her image to suffer in front of her
            family, and she didn’t want them to disapprove of the boy. Her family had warned her against talking or
            getting close to the boy because his academic performance was lacking. Who knew what the future held?
            Subsequently, the girl distanced herself from him, seeming to no longer care. However, the boy remained
            deeply attached to the girl, unable to erase her from his thoughts. He found himself dreaming of her,
            entangled in a spell within his dreams. Realizing the persistence of these dreams, the boy began
            sleeping
            excessively, hoping that she would appear in his dreams.</p>
